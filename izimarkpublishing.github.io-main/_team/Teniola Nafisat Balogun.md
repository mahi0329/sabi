Teniola Nafisat Balogun is a Nigerian Creative Writer and was born on 31st May 2002, Niger State, Nigeria. She has spent her years in Northern Nigeria.  She started writing at a young age and has a few scattering of poems on the local newspapers. Her motherâ€™s love for books was one of the reasons she began writing. Teniola began freelancing in 2017 and has adopted the pen name Tenney Balogun. She has written articles and short fictions but she mostly has a flair for poetry.

She perceives poetry as a realm of personal sanity where only characters exist. Although most of her works are considered dark, Tenney has stretched her pen to write on culture, racism and other social issues.  In her bid to promote poetry, Tenney in 2019 created a platform for poets, The Silent Whisperers NG, alongside her friend and co poet Crosswordz. Tenney is currently an undergraduate student of Bayero University Kano.
