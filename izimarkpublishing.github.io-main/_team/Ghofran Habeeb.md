By day I am a pharmacist and by night & during my free time I work as a writer, translator and medical education specialist.

My specialty is the medical field as it’s my passion! I enjoy my job as a translator and writer because I believe in the ability to change anyone’s mentality for the better with words.

I have spent many hours imagining the tragedy of someone who is illiterate. Imagine needing a little piece of information to help change your life but you can’t seem to grasp it because you can’t read! This is the exact reason why I translate; so that I can help others understand dialogues from different language.

Writing means spreading my knowledge with others, in other words providing value to hopefully change someone’s life for the better.
