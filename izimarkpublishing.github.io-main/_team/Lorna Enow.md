My name is Lorna Enow, a 24-year-old Cameroonian born and bred in Cameroon and currently resident in Yaound√©. Being raised by parents of different walks of life, I had the opportunity to learn a vast array of subject matters early in life, especially because I had the blessing of devoted parents. One of those things which stands out even today is the love for literature and the arts in general. I started doing creative writing unofficially at the age of 11 and only recently decided to be more public about my talent

Poetry to me is a getaway destination, a place where I am at peace even when everything around me seems to be chaotic. I also consider my poems a gift from God to those who read it because it is a voice for the voiceless

Two things I hope to achieve by writing poetry are; to make people more aware and appreciative of this gift especially where I come from, and also to voice out realities of some of the things that are otherwise so hard to talk about.
