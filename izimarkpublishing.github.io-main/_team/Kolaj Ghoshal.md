I am from India, Kolkata. I've been in love with writing
since the day I held a pen. Writing helped me with all my problems and it still does. Pen and paper have always been those things with which I celebrate my happiest days and sob on my saddest nights.

I was the editor in chief of my school magazine for the past 3 years. Books have always been my best friends. I started my first writing journey when I was 12 years old, I wrote for the charitable magazine for the blind. Due to all the academic pressure I had to put my writing career to halt. I am now happy to be back and I will make a pact of never giving up. There is still a lot to learn because I believe a beautiful journey has started over here at izimarkpublishing.
