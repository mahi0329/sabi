Hello Instagram, my name is Siva & I am a medical doctor & soon to be author from Malaysia. For one of my projects in medical school, I teamed up with a course mate to write a rap song about how music therapy helps with mental health problems such as depression and movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease.

That’s when I discovered the magic of fusing evidence-based medical facts (or any scientific facts) into narrative forms of writing. The idea of converting for example, a lengthy journal article about preventing lung tumours which contains difficult medical terminologies that you and I (before medical school) wouldn’t understand, into a relatable story is just functional, don’t you think?

It’s enjoyable to write this way as it is also a special treat for readers who will indirectly benefit from the factual information without much effort.

I am working on my book which is set to be released in 1 month.
