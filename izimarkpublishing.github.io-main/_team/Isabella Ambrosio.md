I have been writing since I was 8 years old. My life has been consumed by writing. I can’t imagine a life without it.

My college degree is in English with Creative Writing, in a country that I immigrated to when I was 15. I currently have a career in music journalism, speaking to musicians that I have been a fan of ever since I was a child. I’ve won awards and placed in competitions for my writing, taken classes outside of school and dedicated years of work to improve my craft.

I take an interest in autobiographical fiction and New Adult topics. I believe issues such as mental health, assault, drug addiction, abuse and more are not spoken about enough.

Through my writing, I hope to create a dialogue about these issues, as well as to let people who are suffering through those traumatic issues that they are not alone. The most important thing someone can discover through their life is that they are truly not alone. There are so many people out there that struggle with the same issues, whether or not they’re vocal about it. I hope my writing can be both a safe place, a discussion topic, and teach hope and perseverance no matter what.

Thank you to IziMarkPublishing for believing in my vision and giving me the platform to share my work.
