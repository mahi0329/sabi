Having passed the national examination she was admitted to join Rongo University in Migori County, Kenya in September 2019 to pursue a degree course in Finance and Banking where she is expected to graduate in 2023.

In 2019 while still in her first year at Rongo University she spent most of her time in the library ready books and later was nominated as an assistant librarian. Towards the end of her first year, she participated in a beauty pageant competition for Mr & Mrs. Rongo University and managed to be crowned Mrs. Rongo University.

She took the opportunity to form groups that help in charity work, especially those affected by the Corona Virus pandemic.
