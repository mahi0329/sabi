I am currently living in Islamabad, Pakistan. I am 23 years old.

I have just completed my graduation in Mass Communication. My majors were PR and Advertising.
I always wanted to express myself in form of words. Writing is something I feel passionate about. Some of my favorite topics for writing are Love, Life and Nature.

I am thankful to Mark J. Tyhurst for providing such a creative platform where I can express my writing abilities freely. I am really excited for my very first book as an Author.
