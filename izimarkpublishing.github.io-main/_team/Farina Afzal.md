I'm a graduate in Political Science and I'm currently enrolled in MPhil Political Science from Kinnaird College, Lahore, Pakistan.

My academic journey from the start has been vigilant and enthusiastic as I have always been very fond of studying and exploring new arenas. That is why I've ended up being a political scientist.

Though my hobbies are quite holistic, writing and reading have been two of my favourite hobbies since childhood, Paulo Coelho being one of my favourite authors. I've been writing articles, academic as well as non-academic, since long now, but I never dreamt of writing a published book ever. I guess fate had other plans for me and I ended up getting in touch with Mark Tyhurst with whom I'm now working to bring my nascent dream of being a published author to reality.

See you all with my book published in a few months!
