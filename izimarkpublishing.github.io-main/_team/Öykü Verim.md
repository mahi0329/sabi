Hi my name is Öykü and I live in Istanbul, Turkey. My favorite thing in the world is writing. It has never changed since I was a child when I used to read under my blanket and wrote my first words about other realms.

Even though I studied a Foreign Language, my University years were full of reading and writing fiction. I’ve always held on to my creative writing lessons and my professors’ guidance. After my graduation, I started to work as a freelance creative writer thanks to this passion and I love my job, more & more, every day. As Faulkner said, "If a story is in you, it has to come out". Embracing this motivation, now, I am working on my first book and this is the most exciting time of my life!
