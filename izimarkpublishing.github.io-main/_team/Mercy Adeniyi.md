I am proudly Nigerian born, raised & reside. I am an Undergraduate student of Civil Engineering.

I have loved writing since I could hold a pen. I started writing stories when I was around 9. I never knew much English because of the place I grew up in but I wrote anyways. My writing has aloud me to propel forwards and excel in the language.

Growing up, I knew writing was for me, I could go days just scribbling ideas on torn sheets. I am a soon-to-be published Author with IziMarkPublishing! I am a multi-niched writer but I feed majorly on feminity and would love to use my pen/voice to help females who do not have the medium to open up.
