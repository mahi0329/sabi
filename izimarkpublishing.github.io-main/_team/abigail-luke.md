My name is Abigail J. Luke. I was born & raised Nigerian.

I am a medical student with a passion for creating a world born out of my own imagination. I write fiction in all genres, I like to dabble into creating a diversion for readers with my words when I'm not too busy reading books or bursting my eardrums with music.
I've been writing for as long as I can remember, started out in high school and I am currently a ghostwriter, and on a journey to becoming a published Author with IziMarkPublishing.

Although I write fiction, all my books have a part of me or the people around me embedded somewhere in the world I create. This is because the stories are born from everything & anything, including; occurring events, life circumstances, or even passive events I experience.
In essence, I love writing, and I am excited to be here.
