My nickname is Malbrid because my first story was the school of mystery. When I started writing I was attending my senior secondary school.

I have always found writing very interesting. When I would write, it almost made me feel like I was in an entire other realm of existence. Somewhere in the stratosphere.

I quickly fell in love with writing, it is my passion and hobby.

I mainly write about science fiction and horror stories with mostly fictional dialect.

Thanks to IziMarkPublishing my dream is about to come true.
