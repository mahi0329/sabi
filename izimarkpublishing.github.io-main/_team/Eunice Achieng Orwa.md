I am 34 years old. I currently live in Kenya. I am a Social Worker knowledgeable in working with vulnerable people. A skilled management psychologist passionate about self-protection and care intervention that encourage participatory empowerment and self-healing.

I have been a social service professional for over 8 years with a Bachelor's Degree focused in Social Work from the University of Nairobi, Kenya.

I am passionate about writing because for me it’s a way of expressing the solutions to challenges faced by countless individuals in our society. I have accumulated vast involvement in working with children and young people from difficult family backgrounds in Kenya. I feel that it is my moral obligation to use these skills to contribute in the formation of a psychologically healthier society.

It is often astounding that what you deem obvious in solving ones problem is excruciatingly hard to another. My impression is that sharing knowledge with the world in this form will ultimately make the solutions understandable to most if not all who are suffering in silence. In my line of study I have found that a little encouragement doesn’t hurt. Letting individuals know that they are not alone in their journey to self-empowerment and healing is key.
