Hi, my name is Faith, I am 19 years old. I live in Karachi, Pakistan. I am absolutely ecstatic to start my journey as an Author.

I am originally a dentistry major and I chose this field to satisfy the mind, however I aspire to be a Author to satisfy the heart.

I always thought that to visualize anything I wanted to see in my mind was somewhat of a super power. To put it into words and give life to it seemed like magic to me.

Thanks to Izimarkpublishing I can finally begin to enliven my dream.
