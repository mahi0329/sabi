She was born and raised in the country of Pakistan. The most important thing in her life is her family. Apart from spending time with family, Kainaat really enjoys reading self help books and be with herself. This is important to her as she believes in the significance of her time alone.

She wants to add the value in the world by using the power and honesty of her words. Kainaat helps businesses succeed using the fuel of right words and this is whatâ€™s the motive of her writing agency KaiWritings (soon to be launched).

And oh yes, she loves chocolates and flowers. These two things are all that's needed to make her feel good.
