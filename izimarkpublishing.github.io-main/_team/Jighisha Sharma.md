Hey, my name is Jigisha. I was born and raised in India all through the twenty years of my life. I am a student of sociology and philosophy, an avid reader and currently a columnist for a digital magazine.

I am very excited as I look forward to starting my journey of becoming a published Author!

I have had an inkling for writing ever since I was introduced to the concept. In high school I studied media studies and performed well in my finals by earning a 4.0+ GPA which motivated me to pursue it in University.

I have consistently looked to learn more to perfect my writing, in both research and non-profit organizational industries. During my high school years, I volunteered to help 22 people become literate in the literacy project. In the past summer I virtually volunteered at WWF-India by creating awareness and doing my bit against the use of plastic. I also volunteered virtually last year for a child rights organization at a community centric NGO.

I play badminton for my University and have played the sport ever since my early days of childhood. I miss being on court now a lot these days due to the aftermath of the pandemic; although I empathize it’s a precaution for everyone’s good health!

I am so grateful and beyond ecstatic in the near future to start my journey towards becoming a published Author!

Thank you for the opportunity IziMarkPublishing.
