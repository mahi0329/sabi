My friends call me Yda, others call me Ivan, due to the fact that I am genderfluid. I am from a small city in the northern regions of the Philippines.

I am the eldest among my siblings and cousins, and we are a family full of musicians.

I graduated with a degree in the Bachelor of Arts in Language and Literature in 2019, and worked as an English tutor for 10-11 months, before eventually quitting during the pandemic.

Currently, I am working as an animator, video editor, and digital artist, all of which are hobbies of mine.

I have always loved books, from an early age of 3, and have fancied the idea of becoming an author one day. I love writing down these crazy ideas, these wonderful fantasies in my head, all brought upon by simple ‘what if’s. I’ve taken a liking to LGBTQ+, romance, mystery, religious satire, and fantasy types of literature.

My room is full of books, and they’ve even taken space in the spare room. I don’t think I can live in a world where books are no longer a thing.
