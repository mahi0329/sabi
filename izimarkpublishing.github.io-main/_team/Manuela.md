¡Hola!

I am Manuela, but you better call me Magú. I am from Colombia and as long as I can remember, I have always had a book in my hands. I love language, words, literature, poetry, books. It just gives me the ultimate joy, it inspires every second of my life.

I have completed a Degree in Philosophy and Literature. To follow my love for books, I was working as a librarian in my hometown Manizales, up in the cold mountains of Colombia.

I then moved to Australia where I studied a Diploma in Early Childhood Education and worked with children for over two years. Due to this, I discovered the magic, importance and delight of children’s literature, and that need that was building up inside my soul of becoming an author. Spreading knowledge throughout books is my ambition based on the love I gained in my mixed career so far.

I can’t leave without adding a few fun facts about myself: I love (can-not-live-without kind of thing!) coffee; I am one of those people that can read many books at a time; I can’t stop buying second hand books and will always review it; I love eating and cooking and, finally, I dance and sing when I am feeling creative.


I look forward to spreading my ideas with the supportive hand of iziMarkPublishing.
