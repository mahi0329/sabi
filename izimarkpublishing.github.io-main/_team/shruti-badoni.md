Shruti Badoni is a 22 year old from New Delhi, India. She has majored in Economics Honours from Delhi University.

Being the only daughter of her parents she has always been very well loved as her parents are her ultimate support system and one of the reasons behind who she is today.

She developed her passion towards writing at a very young age. After winning several creative writing competitions when she was in school to being appreciated by people around her, she finally took this step to get her work published for the first time at the young age of 18 in an anthology; and since then, there’s been no turning back. 

Shruti has also won the REX Karmaveer Chakra Award in the field of writing.

For her, the greatest pleasure lies in seeing people relate to her work — that’s her biggest victory.

Apart from writing, she also likes to read non fictional books & is a big food lover. She is an economics enthusiast and an avid traveller, who supremely loves dogs and likes being fashion forward!
