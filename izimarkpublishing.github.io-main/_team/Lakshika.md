I am a doctor by profession but I love to express myself in form of words. Writing is something which makes me passionate & drives my internal motivation. Some of my favourite topics for writing are love, comedy, horror, knowledge & many more.

I am very thankful to IzimarkPublishing for helping me help lay a proper foundation for my writing career.
