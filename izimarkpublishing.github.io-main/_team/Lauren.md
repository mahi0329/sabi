Hi, I’m Lauren, I was born in Bahrain, raised up in Sri Lanka and currently residing in Bangladesh. I hold a Bachelors in Business Management from Perth Institute of Business and Technology, Australia. My passion is writing and drafting as and when I get an opportunity.

Having worked as a HR Executive and a freelance writer for over a decade, I think it would be best to look forward to accomplishing my dream; to become an Author. My values of believing in my roots and respecting every project I undertake is what shaped me in to who I am. I’ve always had the passion of putting it to pen whenever I accomplished. I also maintain my own travel diary out of habit. 

I have also published at 2 magazine websites in the United States which includes a fashion magazine. I am also a movie craze and that’s one thing I do during my leisure time to relax. Moreover, I have been a gold medalist at the British festival of dancing, speech, and drama for performing a solo dance. 
I intend on delivering nothing but the best!
