Do Medical facts seem difficult and hard to digest? Well, I make them sound like a bedtime story🙂

My name is Shereen “sweet in Farsi”. I'm Egyptian "and Moroccan". I'm a Clinical Pharmacist, a Ph.D. student, and a Harvard Medical School Clinical research program candidate.

A year ago I couldn't write, and now I'm a top writer on Quora, a content writer in several Medical blogs, and an upcoming book author! Well, everything is possible.
