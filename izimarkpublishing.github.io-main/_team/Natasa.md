I was born & raised in the Republic of North Macedonia. I had to learn how to function in a dysfunctional society. Everything was changing and nothing was working properly, so to keep my sanity or insanity, whichever felt better at a given time, and remember who I am or am not, I started writing and I don’t plan on stopping.

Ever since I can remember, for 32 years now, I have been a person of many layers. I have had the desire to live many lives, but in life, we all must decide sooner or later who we are and what we want to become, so I’ve decided to live the lives I wanted through my writing, one page at a time.

I see language as a gift from the universe bestowed upon us to do with it as we see fit. The fittest of ways I’ve chosen, is to use it to create worlds and characters by taking pieces of myself and assembling them into puzzles of fantasy.

To me, writing isn’t just a string of words, but a wormhole to another existence. As a linguist and a translator, I can appreciate the uniqueness of the language and the miracles it is capable of doing, so to write and materialize something that existed only my head is the magic I want to do.
