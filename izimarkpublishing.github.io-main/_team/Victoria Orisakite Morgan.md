Meet Victoria Orisakite Morgan, she is one of our premium authors here at IziMarkPublishing. She was born and raised in Port-Harcourt city, which is located in the southern region of Nigeria. She started writing at the age of six and has never dropped the pen since. From racism, to feminism, to inequality, Victoria isn’t afraid to let her voice be heard about issues that affect our society. “Silence is a long way death sentence,” she says. “Even the dead aren’t that quiet.” If she isn’t writing or spending time with friends and family, you can
almost always find her glued to a book or having a k-drama marathon.

We All Need To Breathe is Victoria’s first book. It is set to be released in April so stay tuned for more information and updates. We look forward to sharing her wealth of knowledge with the world.
