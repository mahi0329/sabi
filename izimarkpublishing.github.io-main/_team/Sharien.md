I was born in Nairobi, Kenya but originated from Sri Lanka.

I am currently pursuing my diploma in business management. I have been a passionate writer ever since I was young. I love how Authors put words together and take you to a whole new world. I think thatâ€™s amazing.

Therefore, whenever I have a chance I usually write as a part time hobby. I have published a couple of marketing articles. I am writing for New York magazines and a couple of blogs too on the side. Aside from this, I also write poetry once in a while. And finally, I am beginning my journey as an Author.

I love music that has captivating and meaningful lyrics - they always draw my attention.

Furthermore, I have won a couple of awards in school and college in writing, reciting poems and dancing as well.

I look forward to delivering uniquely engaging content - one that meets excellence.
