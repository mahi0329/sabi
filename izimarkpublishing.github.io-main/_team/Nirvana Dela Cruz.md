She is an aspiring Author from the Philippines. She's that one kid who looks forward to every school year. The reason for this is simply since it's that time of the year where you get a pile of books to check out. No questions asked. She priorities her books first, school supplies second. All this with the approval of her dad, who was her biggest supporter at the time.

She received a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and became a Registered Psychometrician a few months later. She was a former HR Officer, and then worked for 2 Fortune 500 companies in the BPO industry to support her 2 siblings through school. They are now almost in College.

Nirvana could jam to Twenty One Pilots all day, if her 2 cats are accepting of the situation.
