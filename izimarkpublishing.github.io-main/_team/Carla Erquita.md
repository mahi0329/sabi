Carla is a working mom, a sports enthusiast, and an entrepreneur. She is currently working as a machine operator at a famous international food manufacturing company in the Philippines.

She had been a part of company newsletter as a contributor writer for the past 5 years. Even though she is busy juggling her activities as an employee and as a mother writing and aspiring to become a successful author on on her priority list.

She is on her way with IziMarkPublishing to create the foundation in order to achieve success as an Author. Her own books are on the way this summer! She looks forward to earning a career and benefiting from the freedom of passive income.

Carla, on the other hand, battles with social anxieties. She is now in a phase of learning how to deal with it. Self-help books are her best friends. Despite being an introvert, she expresses the importance of mental health. She is an encourager of her league to become the best version of themselves. In order to pursue their dreams no matter, and to start lifting each other up instead of pulling each other down. One kind word goes a very long way especially to a persons dealing with their own battles.
