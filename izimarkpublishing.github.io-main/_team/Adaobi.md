I was born in Nsukka, a town in Enugu, Nigeria.

I am the first of five kids, and we all grew up getting used to switching to new churches every time Mother was uncomfortable with how G-d seemed to be worshipped. Currently, we are Jewish.

My elementary education was in a school where I was often bullied for being the smallest. The final exams got me into the University of Nigeria Secondary School, the only school my dad thought would always look best on a certificate. I dropped out in 2018. Somehow, we found my way back, and I wrote the final exams in 2018.

In between all of these, I had always been a writer. In JSS3, I started to write my own collection of fairytales, all of which were based on stories my uncle told us during the nights he spent with us in our home, and always under the clear moonlights that came with the harmattan. I quit the collection later on, but there were other novels, one of which I had thought to call “Gods in Love” because I had remembered Rotimi’s “The Gods Are Not To Blame”. I never completed the book. There were other books still, two of which I later pushed myself to complete.

I think I began a bit too early to pursue a career in writing. Maybe because I come from a home where we are made to stick to what is provided for us, no matter how miserly, and to never really work for what we want. Maybe also because I was tired of hearing Mother say I would marry a rich man.

In 2019, I created my own blog. Due to my lack of experience, I was never able to manage it well, and it was deleted. I created two more after, and deletion followed suit. In 2021, I finally came up with one that has been doing well anyway.

Somehow, I think that I have been good enough, even up until I applied to a publishing company called IziMarkPublishing that was willing to help lay a proper foundation for my writing career.
