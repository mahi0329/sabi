My name is Ndidiamaka Ezeliora. I was born and raised in Lagos state Nigeria. 

As a child I always enjoyed reading books and I often found myself hooked on some books for days. My passion for writing started when I discovered I had the amazing ability to think outside the box and turn my ideas into stories. By the age of eleven, I had been able to turn my diary into a short story. When I am not writing, I enjoy baking or watching anime.
