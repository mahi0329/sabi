She was born and raised in Indonesia. She majored in Computer Science in Jakarta, Indonesia.

As a single mother, she always tries to do her best and work for her only child; so her child can get the best education and feel loved. Besides that, she also always teaches her only child to treat others with respect. As respect is a fundamental principal of life & education won’t be sufficient when we don’t have respect for people.

Since becoming a mother, she has started her career as a teacher. Her role is to assist students with special needs. She spends careful time helping them with both their behavior and academics. Her passion for teaching kids has always been in her blood since she graduated from University. Reading stories and sharing knowledge with the kids always has been part of her work for more than 10 years. She is committed to children due to the motherly bonding love for her child.

Pricilla agreed to terms with IziMarkPublishing as she looks forward to working alongside a supportive team of aspiring & soon to be female Authors! She looks forward to starting to publish the stories that she writes.

"I’m really grateful for this opportunity that IziMarkPublishing gave. And I can’t wait to write more fun and adventurous stories.”
