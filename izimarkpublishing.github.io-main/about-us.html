        <p class="fs-1 mb-3 pe-xxl-8">
          If you are currently a writer and work as a freelancer, we offer you
          the opportunity to expand your knowledge and potential by building
          your brand as an Author. We give full credit to our Authors. We also
          support and promote empowerment of women by providing a forum for
          exchange of ideas among our female authors.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-1 mb-3 pe-xxl-8">
          With effort comes reward, but we will handle the stressful side of the
          business. We will help you gain the potential for a stream of income
          over time. Why would you limit yourself and the value of your work by
          accepting ghostwriting contracts to pay a small onetime fee?
          Freelancer has the word free in it because you are essentially selling
          your work at a minimal price compared to the value it can pos-sess. 
        </p>
        <p class="fs-1 mb-5 pe-xxl-8">
          We look forward to helping you through the steps in the publishing
          process. We can help you publish your first, second, or subsequent
          books. We sign every Author to a one-book contract to start with, to
          allow Authors flexibility in their individual careers.
